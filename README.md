# ASSIGNMENT-3-
Module 4: Functions &amp; Modules in Python 
#Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 


#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
#1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
#2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
#3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

Step:1 The first step to take a veriable which contain user input in integer.
Step:2 after that make a Function with name fact with a single parameter.
Step:3 in faction "Fact()" we use if-else statment for getting factorial of user input (int)
Step:4 with "if condition" if "a" is less than 2 it will return 1. "else" return "a" multiply to previous value "a"
Step:5 take an second Veriable  which contain result of fact function.
step:6 print ("Factorial of" ,a ,"is:", result).

#Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
 
#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
#1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
#2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
# o   Square root of the number
# o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
# o   Sine of the number (in radians)

Step:1 import math library
step:2 take "a" as user input veriable.
step:3 print("Square root:",a**2)
step:4 print("Natural logarithm:",math.log(a))
step:5 print("Sine of the number:",math.sin(a))
